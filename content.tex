It will basically explain that CVMs provide the triplets of Vs, Vp and density, and, as an example, we can expand on a description of CVM-S and CVM-H, including their variations CVM-SI and CVM-H+GTL.}\section{The UCVM Software Framework}\label{sec:ucvm}The primary functionality provided by UCVM is the ability to query a wide array of community velocity models for material properties in a standard way. Once a velocity model has been successfully integrated with UCVM, the framework can be utilized to query for the primary and sheer seismic wave velocities ($Vp$, $Vs$) as well as the soil/rock density ($\rho$) at any geographic point within that model. The original model's local coordinate system and map projection are concealed behind a generic interface that instead allows queries by geographic latitude and longitude along with a vertical z-coordinate. The z-axis may be defined as either depth below the free surface or elevation relative to mean sea level.To support this flexible query mechanism consistently across all models, UCVM includes a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM). The DEM is synthesized from the USGS National Elevation Dataset (TODO: cite USGS NED) and the ETOPO1 Global Relief Model (TODO: cite ETOPO1). It currently spans the State of California along with portions of surrounding States. However, it may be modified to cover any arbitrary region of the Earth's surface, provided adequate resolution elevation datasets exist. An additional advantage to providing the built-in DEM is that UCVM is able to return the surface elevation at any query point in addition to the traditional $Vp$, $Vs$, and $\rho$ parameters.\begin{figure}\centering\epsfig{file=UCVM_Tiling_Concept.pdf,scale=0.35}\caption{Tiling of velocity models (TODO: Redo/cleanup this figure).}\label{fig:tiling}\end{figure}The framework further extends the standardized interface by allowing multiple velocity models to be aggregated into a single composite model. Composition is accomplished by tiling two or more velocity models in three dimensions according to a user-specified priority ordering. Under this scheme, a query point is submitted sequentially to each velocity model within the ordered list that comprises the composite. The first model to return valid velocity data for the point is considered to have fulfilled the data request and subsequent models are not queried. Thus, overlap among the individual models is acceptable and their relative priority ordering arbitrates which one satisfies any given query. Generally, no smoothing is performed at the interfaces between models (an exception is interpolation between a geotechnical layer and a crustal model as discussed later in this paper). This tiling concept is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:tiling}.Community velocity models vary widely in their area of coverage, depth extent, and resolution. UCVM is flexible in its support for such variability. However, in order to better accommodate high frequency ground motion simulations, it categorizes models into two general groups: crustal models, and geotechnical layers (GTLs). Crustal models provide subsurface seismic wave velocities associated with basin, crust, and mantle structures. These models may potentially extend to many tens of kilometers below the Earth's surface yet do so at coarse resolutions (TODO: cite CVM-H, CVM-S). Geotechical layers, in contrast, provide velocities for only the near-surface (typically a few hundred meters) at very high resolution (TODO: cite Ely Vs30 GTL). Ground motion simulations, in particular, rely on high-resolution near-surface velocities and therefore a GTL serves to supplement the coarser data provided by crustal models.TODO: Interpolation of GTL with Crustal\subsection{Utilities}\subsubsection{Querying}\subsubsection{Gridding and Meshing}\subsubsection{UCVM and the Etree Library}\subsubsection{New DEMs and Vs30 Maps}\subsection{Parallel Utilities}\subsection{Application Programming Interface}\section{Computational Performance}\label{sec:conclusions}\textit{\color{blue}It would be desirable to do some experiments in terms of performance, especially for the parallel applications utilities in UCVM.
