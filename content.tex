It will basically explain that CVMs provide the triplets of Vs, Vp and density, and, as an example, we can expand on a description of CVM-S and CVM-H, including their variations CVM-SI and CVM-H+GTL.}\section{The UCVM Software Framework}\label{sec:ucvm}The primary functionality provided by UCVM is the ability to query a wide array of community velocity models for material properties in a standard way. Once a velocity model has been successfully integrated with UCVM, the framework can be utilized to query for the primary and shear seismic wave velocities ($Vp$, $Vs$) as well as the soil/rock density ($\rho$) at any geographic point within that model. The original model's local coordinate system and map projection are concealed behind a generic interface that instead allows queries by geographic latitude and longitude along with a vertical z-coordinate. The z-axis may be defined as either depth below the free surface or elevation relative to mean sea level.To support this flexible query mechanism consistently across all models, UCVM includes a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM). The DEM is synthesized from the USGS National Elevation Dataset (TODO: cite USGS NED) and the ETOPO1 Global Relief Model (TODO: cite ETOPO1). It currently spans the State of California along with portions of surrounding States. However, it may be modified to cover any arbitrary region of the Earth's surface, provided adequate resolution elevation datasets exist. An additional advantage to providing the built-in DEM is that UCVM is able to return the surface elevation at any query point in addition to the traditional $Vp$, $Vs$, and $\rho$ parameters.\begin{figure}\centering\epsfig{file=UCVM_Tiling_Concept.pdf,scale=0.35}\caption{Tiling of velocity models (TODO: Redo/cleanup this figure).}\label{fig:tiling}\end{figure}The framework further extends the standardized interface by allowing multiple velocity models to be aggregated into a single composite model. Composition is accomplished by tiling two or more velocity models in three dimensions according to a user-specified priority ordering. Under this scheme, a query point is submitted sequentially to each velocity model within the ordered list that comprises the composite. The first model to return valid velocity data for the point is considered to have fulfilled the data request and subsequent models are not queried. Thus, overlap among the individual models is acceptable and their relative priority ordering arbitrates which one satisfies any given query. Generally, no smoothing is performed at the interfaces between models (an exception is interpolation between a geotechnical layer and a crustal model as discussed later in this paper). This tiling concept is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:tiling}.Community velocity models vary widely in their area of coverage, depth extent, and resolution. UCVM is flexible in its support for such variability. However, in order to better accommodate high frequency ground motion simulations, it categorizes models into two general groups: crustal models, and geotechnical layers (GTLs). Crustal models provide subsurface seismic wave velocities associated with basin, crust, and mantle structures. These models may potentially extend to many tens of kilometers below the Earth's surface yet do so at coarse resolutions (TODO: cite CVM-H, CVM-S). Geotechical layers, in contrast, provide velocities for only the near-surface (typically a few hundred meters) at very high resolution (TODO: cite Ely Vs30 GTL). Ground motion simulations, in particular, rely on high-resolution near-surface velocities and therefore a GTL serves to supplement the coarser data provided by crustal models.\begin{figure}\centering\epsfig{file=place_holder.pdf,scale=0.35}\caption{Interpolation of GTL and crustal model.}\label{fig:interpolation}\end{figure}Whereas a set of velocity models consisting only of crustal models is aggregated by the tiling mechanism described above, a more sophisticated interpolation mechanism is employed if one or more GTLs are involved. The primary motivation for performing interpolation in this particular case is to eliminate near-surface discontinuities in the composite model which would adversely affect ground motion simulations. When a GTL is specified in the ordered list of models, the framework creates a default interpolation zone along the z-axis over which smoothing between this GTL and the underlying crustal models is performed. Query points that fall within the zone are assigned an interpolated velocity based on the GTL velocity at the top of the zone boundary and the crustal model velocity at the bottom. By default, linear interpolation is used for the smoothing but both the zone dimensions and interpolation function can be modified by the user. Figure \ref{fig:interpolation} illustrates how this interpolation is performed. A single geotechnical layer is currently supported, based on Ely's Vs30-derived algorithm (TODO: cite Ely Vs30-derived GTL). This algorithm procedurally estimates $Vp$, $Vs$, and $\rho$ from the Vs30 velocity at the point of interest. To that end, two separate Vs30 maps are provided for use with the Ely GTL, and each covers the same geographic region as the DEM (namely, California). One map is based on the the Wills and Walls dataset (TODO: cite Wills and Wald), and the other is based on the Yong dataset (TODO: cite Yong). Alternative Vs30 maps may be integrated as new datasets become available. As with the surface elevation from the DEM, the raw Vs30 value from the Vs30 map is returned by UCVM for each query point.\subsection{Command-line Utilities}\subsubsection{Querying}TODO: command-line query\subsubsection{Meshing}TODO: single core and parallel meshing/etree extraction\subsection{Application Programming Interface}TODO: how to interface programmatically with UCVM\subsubsection{Integrating New DEMs, Vs30 Maps, and Community Velocity Models}TODO: describe how to support new DEMs, Vs30 maps, and models\section{Computational Performance}\label{sec:conclusions}\textit{\color{blue}It would be desirable to do some experiments in terms of performance, especially for the parallel applications utilities in UCVM.
