With some examples of how long the same thing would take if doing it differently. We will need to discuss this.%}%%\section{Recent Case Applications}%\label{sec:conclusions}%%\textit{%\color{blue}%This section will be dedicated to show case applications. Some ideas for potential subsections follow.%}%%\subsection{Visualization and Model Comparisons}%%\subsection{Chino Hills Simulation Series}%%\subsection{CyberShake}%%\section{Summary and Conclusions}%\label{sec:conclusions}%%\textit{%\color{blue}%A couple of paragraphs with a summary of what is shown in the paper and a few key conclusions about the impact that we expect UCVM has already have and will have on earthquake research.%}
