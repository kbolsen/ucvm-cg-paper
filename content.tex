It will basically explain that CVMs provide the triplets of Vs, Vp and density, and, as an example, we can expand on a description of CVM-S and CVM-H, including their variations CVM-SI and CVM-H+GTL.}\section{The UCVM Software Framework}\label{sec:ucvm}The primary functionality provided by UCVM is the ability to query a wide array of community velocity models for material properties in a standard way. Once a velocity model has been successfully integrated with UCVM, the framework can be utilized to query for the primary and sheer wave velocities ($Vp$, $Vs$) as well as the soil/rock density ($\rho$) at any geographic point within that model. The original model's local coordinate system and map projection are concealed behind a generic interface that instead allows queries by geographic latitude and longitude along with a vertical z-coordinate. The z-axis may be defined as either depth below the free surface or elevation relative to mean sea level.To support this flexible query mechanism consistently across all models, UCVM includes a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM). The DEM is synthesized from the USGS National Elevation Dataset (TODO: cite USGS NED) and the ETOPO1 Global Relief Model (TODO: cite ETOPO1). It currently spans the State of California along with portions of surrounding States. However, it may be modified to cover any arbitrary region of the Earth's surface, provided adequate resolution elevation datasets exist. An additional advantage to providing the built-in DEM is that UCVM is able to return the surface elevation at any query point in addition to the traditional $Vp$, $Vs$, and $\rho$ parameters.\begin{figure}\centering\epsfig{file=UCVM_Tiling_Concept.pdf,scale=0.35}\caption{Tiling of velocity models (TODO: Redo/cleanup this figure).}\label{fig:tiling}\end{figure}The framework further extends the standardized interface by allowing multiple velocity models to be combined into a composite model that may be queried in an identical manner. Composition is accomplished by tiling two or more velocity models in three dimensions according to a user-specified priority ordering. Each query point is submitted to each velocity model in that list, one model at a time, in priority order. The first model to return valid velocity data for the point is considered to have fullfilled the data request and subsequent models are not queried. Generally, no smoothing is performed at the interfaces between models (an exception is interpolation between a GTL and a crustal model as discussed later in this paper). This tiling concept is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:tiling}.(TODO: GTL versus crustal model)\subsection{Concept of Operation}\subsection{Utilities}\subsubsection{Querying}\subsubsection{Gridding and Meshing}\subsubsection{UCVM and the Etree Library}\subsubsection{Parallel Utilities}\subsection{Application Programming Interface}\section{Computational Performance}\label{sec:conclusions}\textit{\color{blue}It would be desirable to do some experiments in terms of performance, especially for the parallel applications utilities in UCVM.
