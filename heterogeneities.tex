\subsection{Realistic High-Frequency Ground Motion}

\textcolor{red}{Pending contribution to be asked of Kim Olsen. It should focus on how UCVM small-scale heterogeneities generator is helping advance ground motion simulations toward a more realistic representation of high-frequency shaking characteristics. This section would be well-accompanied with a figure comparing ground motion with and without small scale heterogeneities.}
