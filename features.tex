\label{sec:features}

The UCVM platform offers an API and a set of programs, many of which can be used either in a single processor context or in parallel. This section details the most relevant of these programs, categorized by the broad feature they are intended to support. The discussion will focus largely on how the single processor programs operate. Those features that have additional support for parallel computing will be noted, and any operational differences between the single core and parallel implementations are also described.

The single-core commands can be run in any system where the platform has been successfully installed. The parallel commands, however, require a system where the standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) library and compilers are available. Single-core commands are useful to most users interested in exploring the properties of the regions covered by the models supported by the platform. On the other hand, advanced users needing to build large-scale (regional) materialized velocity models for earthquake modeling and simulation are the more likely to use the MPI commands.
