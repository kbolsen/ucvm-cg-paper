	ground motions are generated chiefly by shear- and surface-wave arrivals.
	Because Vp data are more common than Vs data, many researchers first
	develop a Vp model and convert it to a Vs model. I describe recent
	empirical relations between Vs, Vp, Qs, Qp, and density that allow

	a regional 3D velocity model for southern California, based on pre-1970

	relations, show a rapid increase in Vs as Vp increases to 3.5 km/sec
	leading to higher shear-wave velocities in young sedimentary deposits

	velocity (Vp) versus depth relationships for several important rock
	types in northern California used in constructing the new USGS Bay
	Area Velocity Model 05.0.0 [http://www.sf06simulation.org/]. These
	rock types include the Jurassic and Cretaceous Franciscan Complex
	(metagraywacke and greenstones), serpentinites, Cretaceous Salinian
	and Sierra granites and granodiorites, Jurassic and Cretaceous Great
	Valley Sequence, and older Cenozoic sedimentary rocks (including
	the La Honda basin). Similar relations for less volumetrically important
	rocks are also developed for andesites, basalts, gabbros, and Sonoma
	Volcanics. For each rock type I summarize and plot the data used
	to develop the velocity versus depth relationships. These plots document
	the existing constraints on the proposed relationships. This report
	also presents a new empirical Vp versus depth relation derived from
	hundreds of measurements in USGS 30-m vertical seismic profiles (VSPs)
	for Holocene and Plio-Quaternary deposits in the San Francisco Bay
	area. For the upper 40 m (0.04 km) these mainly Holocene deposits,
	can be approximated by Vp (km/s) = 0.7 + 42.968z - 575.8z2 + 2931.6z3
	- 3977.6z4, where z is depth in km. In addition, this report provides
	tables summarizing these VSP observations for the various types of
	Holocene and Plio-Quaternary deposits. In USGS Bay Area Velocity
	Model 05.0.0 these compressional wave velocity (Vp) versus depth
	relationships are converted to shear wave velocity (Vs) versus depth
	relationships using recently proposed empirical Vs versus Vp relations.
	Density is calculated from Vp using Gardner's rule and relations
	for crystalline rocks proposed by Christensen and Mooney (1995).
	Vs is then used to calculate intrinsic attenuation coefficients for
	shear and compressional waves, Qs and Qp, respectively.},

	of wave propagation and site effects in urban regions. In this work
	we study the impact of a potential major earthquake on the San Andreas
	Fault with significant seismic hazard in the Greater Los Angeles
	Basin. We present results for the ShakeOut simulation---a rupture
	beginning near Salton Sea, California, heading 270 km northwest along
	the fault, that produces a Mw 7.8 earthquake in a geographical region
	which includes all major populated areas of Southern California and
	northern Mexico, in a 600 km by 300 km by 80 km volume, for a maximum
	frequency of 1.0 Hz and a minimum shear wave velocity of 200 m/s.
	For the material model, we use a discretized version of SCEC's CVM4
	velocity model, called CVM-Etree. The simulation was performed at
	the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center using Hercules, a finite element
	octree-based, parallel software developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie
	Mellon University. Hercules implements a highly efficient end-to-end
	algorithm for solving the wave field in highly heterogeneous media
	due to kinematic faulting. We verify our results by comparing synthetic
	seismograms computed with a parallel finite difference code by Robert
	Graves (URS) for a similar scenario earthquake, for a maximum frequency
	of 0.5 Hz and minimum shear wave velocity of 500 m/s. We focus our
	analysis of the results of the 1.0 Hz ShakeOut simulation on the
	Los Angeles Basin area, and the Santa Clara River Valley and Oxnard
	Plain. We examine the site effects present in these two areas and
	their proneness to capture and amplify seismic waves due to their
	geological features. Results show a direct correlation between the
	amplification levels and the local soil and basin profiles.},

	by using seismic velocities from boreholes, reflection/refraction

	is further refined and the seismic attenuation is estimated through
	waveform modeling of weak motions from small local events and strong-ground

	to an upper frequency of 1 Hz using a parallelized finite-difference

	spacing to reduce memory requirements. Cenozoic basins trap and strongly
	amplify ground motions. This effect is particularly strong in the
	Evergreen Basin on the northeastern side of the Santa Clara Valley,
	where the steeply dipping Silver Creek fault forms the southwestern
	boundary of the basin. In comparison, the Cupertino Basin on the
	southwestern side of the valley has a more moderate response, which

	Surface waves play a major role in the ground motion of sedimentary

	horizontal node spacing, which we then use as the starting model
	for a finer-scale inversion using double-difference tomography applied

	20 km and assemble our final statewide VP model by stitching together

	S picks from both the Southern California Seismic Network and USArray,

	previous models, extending 570 km in the SW–NE direction and 1320
	km in the NW-SE direction. It also extends to greater depth due to
	the inclusion of substantial data at large epicentral distances.
	Our VP model generally agrees with previous separate regional models
	for northern and southern California, but we also observe some new
	features, such as high-velocity anomalies at shallow depths in the
	Klamath Mountains and Mount Shasta area, somewhat slow velocities
	in the northern Coast Ranges, and slow anomalies beneath the Sierra
	Nevada at midcrustal and greater depths. This model can be applied

	earthquake ground motion, and with how individual buildings interact
	with the surrounding soil and with each other. We conduct a parametric
	study using Hercules, the parallel octree-based finite element earthquake
	simulator developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie Mellon University.
	Because of the necessity of performing repeated ground motion simulations
	, our analysis is based on the Domain Reduction Method (DRM), a modular
	two-step finite element methodology for modeling earthquake ground
	motion in highly heterogeneous localized regions. Buildings are included
	by modifying Hercules' finite-element meshing routines so that they
	are incorporated as additional block elements that are adjusted to
	emulate the general geometric and dynamic characteristics of buildings
	in city-like arrangements. We conduct our study in the greater Los
	Angeles basin using the main shock of 1994 Northridge earthquake
	for frequencies up to 2 Hz and a domain size of 85x85x42.5 km3 as
	the first step of the DRM. Then, we reduce the size of the region
	to a small subdomain of 2x2x1 km3 within the downtown Los Angeles
	region and introduce the building structures, for the second step
	of the DRM, in order to perform the repeated simulations of the parametric
	study.},
