This work was supported by a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to SCEC: SI2-SSI: A Sustainable Community Software Framework for Petascale Earthquake Modeling (ACI-1148493). SCEC is funded by NSF Cooperative Agreement EAR-0529922 and U.S.~Geological Survey Cooperative Agreement 07HQAG0008. The SCEC contribution number for this paper is \textcolor{red}{XXXX}. This research is also part of the Blue Waters sustained-petascale computing project, which is supported by NSF (OCI-0725070) and the state of Illinois. Blue Waters is a joint effort of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and its National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). Computational support was posible through a PRAC allocation supported by NSF award: Petascale Research in Earthquake System Science on Blue Waters (PressOnBlueWaters) (NSF ACI-0832698); and the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) program supported by NSF (OCI-1053575). Additional computations were also performed on Kraken at the U.S.~National Institute for Computational Sciences (NICS). We want to extend a special acknowledgement to community velocity modelers Harold Magistrale, John Shaw, Andreas Plesch, Peter S\"{u}ss, Carl Tape, Guoqing Lin, En-Jui Lee, Po Chen, Robert W.~Graves, and many other model contributors. UCVM would not be possible without your models and your input at various development stages during the years have been invaluable. We also want to thank the Carnegie Mellon etree library development group led by David O'Hallaron for their multiple direct and indirect contributions.
