\label{sec:cvms}

The UCVM framework supports different seismic velocity models.

%This section will present how CVMs work and the various CVMs available to the community today. It will basically explain that CVMs provide the triplets of Vs, Vp and density, and, as an example, we can expand on a description of CVM-S and CVM-H, including their variations CVM-SI and CVM-H+GTL.
