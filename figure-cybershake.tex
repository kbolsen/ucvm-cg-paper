    \caption{Ratio between two CyberShake seismic hazard maps obtained using two different velocity models, CVM-S4.26 and CVM-H. The underlying hazard maps correspond to a 3-seconds spectral acceleration with a 2\% chance of exceedance in 50 years. The discrete regular grids used as input for these computations were built using UCVM meshing utilities.}
