\begin{abstract}This paper presents the Unified Community Velocity Model (UCVM) software framework developed at the Southern California Earthquake Center. UCVM is a collection of software tools and application programming interfaces designed to provide standard access to multiple seismic velocity models used in seismology and geophysics research. Seismic velocity models are key components of current research efforts dedicated to advancing our knowledge of the Earth's crustal structure and its influence on the ground response during earthquakes, including both the regional deep geology and local effects due to the geometry, spatial distribution, and material composition of sediments in basins and valleys. UCVM provides a framework to facilitate research activities that involve the use of seismic velocity models and has particular direct applications in physics-based earthquake ground-motion simulation and seismic hazard analysis in large regions prone to earthquakes, such as Southern California. We describe the background that led to the development of the UCVM and its various software components, including advanced high-performance computer tools available within UCVM, its performance, and product deliverables. We also present examples of recent applications that use UCVM tools or output datasets.\end{abstract}
