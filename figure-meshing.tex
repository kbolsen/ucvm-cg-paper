	\caption{Construction of a structured grid with the programs \texttt{ucvm2mesh} and \texttt{ucvm2mesh-mpi}. An important aspect of the meshing-to-grid process is that the discretized information payload (\vs{}, \vp{}, and $\rho$) is stored at the grid points. The querying and assignment process has a 1-to-1 mapping between the querying point and the grid node.}
