	\caption{Construction of a structured grid with the programs \texttt{ucvm2mesh} (green arrows) and \texttt{ucvm2mesh-mpi} (blue arrows). An important aspect of the gridding process is that the discretized information payload (\vs{}, \vp{}, and $\rho$) is stored at the grid points. That is, the querying and assignment process has a 1-to-1 mapping between the queried point and the grid node of the mesh.}
